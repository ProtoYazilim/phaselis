# AccordionList

The `AccordionList` component is designed for displaying a collection of collapsible items, making it easy to organize and present information in a structured manner. This component supports single or multiple expansion modes and can be customized using various props and styles to suit different design requirements.

## Import

```js
import { AccordionList } from "phaselis";
```

## Usage

### Basic AccordionList

```jsx
<AccordionList
  data={[
    { header: "Section 1", child: <Text>Details for section 1</Text> },
    { header: "Section 2", child: <Text>Details for section 2</Text> },
    { header: "Section 3", child: <Text>Details for section 3</Text> },
  ]}
/>
```

## Props

### data
`{ header: string; child: ReactNode }[]`

An array of objects where each object represents an accordion item. The `header` key is used to display the header text of the item, and the `child` key represents the content that will be revealed when the item is expanded.


```jsx
const data = [
  { header: "Introduction", child: <Text>Welcome to our guide!</Text> },
  { header: "Details", child: <Text>Here are some detailed explanations.</Text> },
];
```

### expandMode
` single | multiple `

Defines the behavior for item expansion. If set to `"single"`, only one item can be expanded at a time. If set to `"multiple"`, multiple items can be expanded simultaneously.


```jsx
<AccordionList expandMode="single" />
```

### defaultExpandedIndex
`number[]`

Specifies the indices of items that should be expanded by default when the component is rendered.


```jsx
<AccordionList defaultExpandedIndex={[0, 2]} />
```

### onChange
`(index: number) => void`

A callback function that is triggered when an accordion item is expanded or collapsed. It receives the index of the item that was toggled as a parameter.


```jsx
<AccordionList onChange={(index) => console.log("Toggled item at index:", index)} />
```

### style
| Name        | Type      | Description                                   |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `container` | ViewStyle | Style for the outer container of the accordion list. |
| `element`   | ViewStyle | Style for the individual accordion item elements.     |

Allows customization of the appearance of the `AccordionList`, including the container and the items.


```jsx
<AccordionList
  style={{
    container: { borderColor: "#ddd", borderWidth: 1, padding: 10 },
    element: { backgroundColor: "#f7f7f7", marginBottom: 5 },
  }}
/>
