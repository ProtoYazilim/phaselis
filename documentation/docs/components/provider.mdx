  The Provider component is used to set up a context for managing themes and breakpoints across your application.
---

The `Provider` component establishes a context for theming and responsive breakpoints, enabling consistent styling and layout handling throughout your application. It serves as a wrapper for other components to inherit themes and layout properties based on breakpoints.

## Import

Phaselis exports one main component for Provider.

```js
import { Provider } from "phaselis";
```

- **Provider:** Main Component import for Provider

## Usage

### Basic Provider

```jsx
import { View } from "react-native";
import { LucideIcon, Provider, lightTheme } from "phaselis";

export default function PhaselisScreen() {
  return (
    <Provider theme={lightTheme}>
      <View
        style={{
          flex: 1,
          justifyContent: "center",
          padding: 20,
        }}
      >
        <LucideIcon name="Star" style={{ color: "#144194" }} />
      </View>
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

## Props
:::tip

Apart from the listed props below, you can pass any other prop as required by the context setup.

:::

### children
`ReactNode`

The child components wrapped by the `Provider`, which will inherit the theme and breakpoint settings.

```jsx
import { customTheme } from "phaselis";
```
```jsx
<Provider theme={customTheme}>
  {...}
</Provider>
```

### breakpoints
`object`

Optional object to define custom breakpoints for responsive design. If not provided, defaults to:
- `xl`: 1440
- `lg`: 1024
- `md`: 768
- `xs`: 0

```jsx
<Provider
  breakpoints={{
    xl: 1600,
    lg: 1200,
    md: 900,
    xs: 0,
  }}
>
  {...}
</Provider>
```

### theme
`object`

An optional theme object to provide custom styling options. This can include colors, spacings, typography, and other design tokens.

```jsx
import { lightTheme } from "phaselis";
```
```jsx
<Provider theme={lightTheme}>

</Provider>
```

## Exported Components and Hooks

- **PhaselisContext**: The context created by `Provider` for access to theme and breakpoint settings.
- **PhaselisHOC**: Higher Order Component to wrap components for easy access to the Phaselis context.
- **useColors**: Hook to access color definitions from the theme.
- **useSpacings**: Hook to access spacing definitions from the theme.
- **useTheme**: Hook to retrieve the entire theme object and apply it in components.

By setting up `Provider` at the root of your application, all components gain access to the defined theme and responsive breakpoints, promoting a cohesive and adaptable design system.
