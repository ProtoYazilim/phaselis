Theme is a collection of styles that are applied to an entire application, typically including colors, typography, and spacing. Phaselis provides a way to customize the theme of your app.

## How it works 

Phaselis uses a theme object to style components. The theme object is a JavaScript object that contains a set of key-value pairs. Each key represents a style property, and each value represents the value of that property.

the styling system is supported by `unistyles` package, which is a utility package that provides a way to create styles in a more readable and maintainable way.

### Create a custom theme

To create a custom theme, you need to create a theme object . You can also use existing theme values by extending the default theme.

```jsx
import { lightTheme } from 'phaselis';

const customTheme = {
  ...lightTheme,
    colors: {
        ...lightTheme.colors,
        primary: 'red',
    },
};
```

### Apply the custom theme

To apply the custom theme, you need to wrap your app with the `PhaselisProvider` component and pass the custom theme as a prop.

```jsx
import { Provider as PhaselisProvider } from 'phaselis';
...
return (
  <PhaselisProvider theme={customTheme}>
    <App />
  </PhaselisProvider>
);
```

Checkout the default theme values [here](https://github.com/ProtoYazilim/phaselis/blob/main/src/theme/lightTheme.tsx) for more information.
