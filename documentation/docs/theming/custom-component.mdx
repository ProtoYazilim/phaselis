Phaselis provides a way to customize the theme of your components.

## How it works
Phaselis components have diffrent style variants , states and attributes. Let's  say you want to change the border color and radius of the select component. You can do this by passing a `borderColor` prop to the components container attribute.

```jsx
import { lightTheme } from 'phaselis';

const theme = {
    ...
    select: {    // component name
        container : {   // target container
            borderColor: '#ff0000',
            borderRadius: 16,
        },
        element : { // target element
            fontFamily: "Poppins", // 
            color: '#000000',
            justifyContent: "flex-end",
        }
    }
    ...
};
```

> In this example, we are changing the `borderColor` and `borderRadius` of the select component. You can change any style attribute of any component by passing the attribute to the components container object.


:::info
  Why its so nested? 
  Phaselis uses a theme object to style components. The theme object is a JavaScript object that contains a set of key-value pairs. Each key represents a style property, and each value represents the value of that property. Each component has sections that you can style, for example for Select there are container,element,leftSlot,rightSlot. you can also check [Select style prop] for more information.

* Its just that simple. You can change any style attribute of any component by passing the attribute to the components container object.
