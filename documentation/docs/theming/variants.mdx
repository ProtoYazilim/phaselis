Variants are a way to style components in different ways. Phaselis provides a way to customize the theme of your components.

## How it works

Phaselis components have diffrent style variants , states and attributes. Let's  say you want to change the focus border color of the textfield component. You can do this by passing a `borderColor` prop to the button components container attribute.

```jsx
import { lightTheme } from 'phaselis';

const theme = {
    textfield: {    // component name
        container : {   // target container
            variants : {    // target variants
                focus : {   // variant key
                    true : { // variant condition
                        borderColor: 'aqua', // style attribute
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

> In this example, we are changing the `borderColor` of the textfield component when the focus variant is true. You can change any style attribute of any component by passing the attribute to the components container object.

:::info
  You can also create your own variants. define your variant on theme object .It will be avaliable right away. then execute the following command to generate the interface for the new variant.
  
  ```bash
  npm run generate-variants
  ```
    This command will generate the interface for new variants.
